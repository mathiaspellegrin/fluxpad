# FluxPad

Thought for a second
FluxPad is a multi-agent AI platform built on the Conflux blockchain. It streamlines on-chain tasks through specialized AI agents that handle everything from token/NFT creation to real-time market analysis and automated social media updates. By integrating smart contracts, AI-driven functionalities, and various social platforms, FluxPad simplifies asset management, community governance, and ecosystem onboarding.

## Key Features

FluxPad is available at [https://fluxpad.org/](https://fluxpad.org/), providing users with a comprehensive online platform to interact with its powerful AI agents and explore the Conflux ecosystem.

A demo of FluxPad is available at [https://youtu.be/zMIFPvWzAqU](https://youtu.be/zMIFPvWzAqU), showcasing its features and functionality.

FluxPad utilizes the following resources:

- **Contracts:**
  - Factory token/NFT creation: [View Contract](https://evmtestnet.confluxscan.net/address/0x8db86ab5c72b875af8c7b36a4d916f071e1c9a78?tab=contract-viewer)
  - Vote contract: [View Contract](https://evmtestnet.confluxscan.io/address/0x2b77b6f8c5b7c7d5115df095d75a09238081ea7f?tab=contract-viewer)
- **Community Channels:**
  - Discord: [Join FluxPad Community](https://discord.gg/5ZhArVUzUT)
  - Telegram bot: [@FluuxPadbot](https://t.me/FluuxPadbot)
  - Leo X account: [Follow Leo on X](https://x.com/leofluxpad)

The AI agents in the demo use the following addresses:

- **LEO_AI_AGENT**: `0x51741B5d4D28E2aA25d1366b0DdFc3681DB18Ec2`
- **ERZA_AI_AGENT**: `0xf1d770cc446D5630D3eBC96f5D97e3561F65b30C`
- **DEBRA_AI_AGENT**: `0x7791742f795ed16Ae35F0dD56054940dC81944f9`
- **ARIA_AI_AGENT**: `0x287A89387892A3Bd28F972962a7E345340923AB9`
- **MATHIAS_AI_AGENT**: `0x4BfDCf2e69a0cB3331812f6547AE5530217C6d35`

In the near future, a dedicated server will be launched to allow developers to access the AI agents directly through endpoints. This server will be accessible at [https://fluxpad-database.com/](https://fluxpad-database.com/).

- **Token & NFT Creation**: Easily mint tokens or NFTs via smart contracts or delegate to the AI agent (Aria).
- **Market Analysis**: Track live price feeds with Debra and receive regular updates on Discord/Telegram.
- **On-Chain Voting**: Vote on proposals directly or through Mathias, eliminating manual contract interactions.
- **Social Media Updates**: Leo handles automated postings on Twitter (X) for project news.
- **Conflux Ecosystem Guidance**: Erza offers tutorials and links for new users exploring the Conflux network.

Use FluxPad for a seamless, AI-powered experience in the Conflux ecosystemâ€”from minting NFTs to coordinating community votes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with blockchain and back-end development.

Ensure you have Node.js installed and set up your environment variables as described in the Environment Variables section.

### Installation

1. Clone the FluxPad repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mathiaspellegrin/fluxpad
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fluxpad
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development and Technology Stack

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for FluxPad's functionality. Ensure these are properly configured in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
PORT=
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=
XAI_API_KEY=
DEBRA_PRIVATE_CFX_WALLET=
LEO_PRIVATE_CFX_WALLET=
ARIA_PRIVATE_CFX_WALLET=
MATHIAS_PRIVATE_CFX_WALLET=
ERZA_PRIVATE_CFX_WALLET=
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
X_API_KEY=
X_API_SECRET_KEY=
FLUXPAD_VOTING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x2B77B6f8C5b7C7d5115dF095D75a09238081ea7f
FLUXPAD_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x8DB86AB5C72b875Af8C7B36A4D916f071e1C9a78
```

### Back-End Logic

The FluxPad platform's back-end leverages Node.js and Express.js to handle AI agent interactions, blockchain communication, and real-time data processing. Key functionalities include:

- Context-aware responses from specialized AI agents.
- Secure handling of user data and project information.
- Integration with Conflux blockchain for smart contract execution and market analysis.
- Automated periodic analysis of project trends and trading patterns.

#### Key Files and Folders
- **`index.js`**: The main server file. This terminal must always be running as it powers the bots and the xLeoBot functionalities.
- **`projects.json`**: Contains the list of all projects tracked by FluxPad.
- **`project_analyses.json`**: Stores the analysis data for the projects.
- **`characters/`**: Contains `characters.json`, which defines the AI agent personalities and prompts.
- **`knowledge/`**: Stores individual project knowledge files (e.g., `conflux.json`, `nucleon.json`), enabling AI agents to access detailed project-specific information.
- **`handlers.json`**: Central file for managing the logic of all AI agents.

Ensure these files and folders are properly configured and updated to maintain functionality.

- **Frontend**: React.js (accessible trough the website)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Conflux eSpace
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for AI agent functionality and Grok xai for Twitter

### Usage

To test FluxPad's features, multiple terminals are required:

1. **Run `fetchCandles`**
   In the first terminal, start the `fetchCandles` process by running:
   ```bash
   node fetchCandles.js
   ```
   This script fetches real-time OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from GeckoTerminal and stores it locally for analysis. Keep this terminal running to ensure continuous updates to the candle data.

2. **Run the Discord Bot**
   In the second terminal, run the Discord bot to enable AI-powered interactions via Discord:
   ```bash
   node discordDebraBot.js
   ```

3. **Run the Telegram Bot**
   In the third terminal, start the Telegram bot to allow users to interact with Debra on Telegram:
   ```bash
   node telegramDebraBot.js
   ```

4. **Run the Main Test File**
   In the fourth terminal, execute the test file to interact with all available AI agents and test their functionalities:
   ```bash
   node test.js
   ```

### Notes:
- Ensure the `.env` file is configured before running any of the scripts.
- If you prefer not to use multiple terminals, you can use tools like `pm2` to manage and run all scripts concurrently in the background.
- `fetchCandles.js` is essential for maintaining up-to-date market data, which the AI agents rely on for accurate analysis.
- Each bot requires its own terminal to function independently, enabling seamless interaction across multiple platforms.
