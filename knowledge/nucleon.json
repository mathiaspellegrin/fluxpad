This means stakers earn rewards without locking up assets for the full duration, solving common issues like illiquidity and high minimum deposits."

        "question": "How does the fee structure work in Nucleon?",

      {
        "question": "Is there a lock-up period for my staked CFX?",
        "answer": "While Nucleon itself doesn’t impose a direct lock-up, Conflux PoS requires ~14 days for withdrawals. Once you burn your xCFX, you must wait for that period to retrieve the underlying CFX."
