# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Repo got a facelift: shorter README, everything that’s “the long version” moved into `/docs`, and the usual repo hygiene (`.gitignore`, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, `.env.example`).

## Initial release

- Multi-agent setup on Conflux—Erza, Debra, Aria, Mathias, Leo.
- Backend API (Express), Discord/Telegram/X bots, the candle fetcher, and the two smart contracts (FluxPadFactory, ProjectVoting).
