# Deployment

TODO: We’ll add real deployment steps when we have them—things like where to host `index.js`, how to keep the bots and `fetchcandles.js` running, and how to wire up env for production.

For now, run everything by hand or with a process manager (e.g. PM2) as in [running.md](running.md).
