# Roadmap

## Next development phase

What we’re aiming for next:

1. **Twitter listener integration.** Agents that actually listen to specific Twitter accounts and react to tweets—real-time engagement instead of one-off posts.

2. **AI-managed trading contracts.** A trading contract where users can park funds with Debra; she’d run them according to user-defined strategies. Automated, strategy-driven trading on Conflux—sounds wild, we know.

3. **Multiple AI collaboration.** Agents sharing context, combining what they do, and giving you one coherent experience across market analysis, voting, and project recommendations instead of four separate conversations.

4. **Deeper Conflux ecosystem integration.** Tighter ties to Conflux-native tools and emerging dApps—less “bolt-on,” more “built-in.”

5. **More AI models.** Extra models for things like sentiment, multi-language, and smarter DeFi project recommendations.

We’re also planning a dedicated server so devs can hit the agents via endpoints (e.g. [https://fluxpad-database.com/](https://fluxpad-database.com/) when it’s live).
